# MHSA_MHRR_data
Summary statistics for VA provided mental health care.  Localization and utilization.
See the info tab of the excel spreadsheet for details.  Regions are defined based on zip code US states+DC.  MHSAs consist of one or more counties.  MHRRs consist of one ore more MHSAs.   The names for the regions are based on the facilities but due to manual shifts to make regions contiguos and reasonable, not all are exact.  In general, the region names shouldn't be interepreted too closely- better to simply identify the counties comprised within.  

The Excel and SAS data are the same.
